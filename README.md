# Near-fault-non-pulse-detection
Analysis of Near Fault Non-Pulse Ground Motions Using Machine Learning Techniques

Built an active model that utilizes deep learning techniques by employing artificial neural networks to analyze seismic data with a training accuracy of 97% by increasing the attributes. 
Designed a web app to check the occurrence of quakes.
The sequential model and Activation function uses the 'ReLu' and 'Sigmoid' functions.
